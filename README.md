Attempt at a chat bot for discord. Still just testing.

History file contains some made up chat history that the bot will try continue based on your input.

I used this video as inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QumfkMQr47M \
It is basically the same thing but wrapped around discord.py instead of a flask app.
